# Library Management System

Small Java console application for managing a library's basic operations (books and simple management). This repository contains the source for a lightweight educational project.

## Project structure

- `src/Book.java` — Book model
- `src/LibraryManager.java` — Core library management logic
- `src/Main.java` — Application entry point

## Requirements

- Java 8 or newer
- Git (for source control)

## Build and run (command line)

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```powershell
javac -d out -sourcepath src src\Main.java src\LibraryManager.java src\Book.java ; java -cp out Main
```

This compiles sources into an `out` directory and runs the `Main` class.
